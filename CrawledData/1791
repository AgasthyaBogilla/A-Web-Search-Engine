<p>A senior academic administrator and a regional banking executive will deliver commencement addresses at two ceremonies on Dec. 15 at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>
<p>A ceremony for the Graduate College will take place at 9 a.m. and an undergraduate ceremony will be held at 2 p.m. at the Credit Union 1 Arena (formerly known as the UIC Pavilion), 525 S. Racine Ave<strong>.</strong></p>

More than 1,400 graduate students and 1,500 undergraduate students are eligible to participate in graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>Emanuel is the vice provost for global initiatives, the Diane v.S. Levy and Robert M. Levy University Professor, and chair of the department of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also the brother of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.</p>

<p>Emanuel received his M.D. from Harvard Medical School and his Ph.D. in political philosophy from Harvard University. He has published more than 300 articles on health care reform, research ethics and end-of-life care, and is the most widely cited bioethicist. His most recent book, “Prescription for the Future,” identifies standout medical organizations that have achieved higher-quality, more patient-focused, and lower-cost care, and from their examples distills 12 transformational practices that could transform the entire healthcare sector.</p>
<p>He was elected to the National Academy of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is a 2018 recipient of the Dan David Prize in the category of bioethics, an honor recognizing innovative and interdisciplinary research that cuts across traditional boundaries and paradigms.</p>

<p>“We were beyond thrilled,” said Meredith Howell, executive director of participation in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Advancement. “Everyone came together, and we had wonderful results.”</p>
<p>At UIC, Giving Tuesday encourages participation among alumni, friends, faculty, staff and students, and aims to build a culture of philanthropy on campus by demonstrating the collective power, and impact, of giving to support the UIC community.</p>
<p>This year, 20 percent of the donors were students, who helped UIC surpass its goals.</p>
<p>“We think it’s great that students are finding ways to get involved through philanthropy,” Howell said. “Giving Tuesday starts from within.”</p>
<p>During IGNITE GivingTuesday, UIC hosted a student contest to identify areas on campus that are results of private philanthropy. Winning students could designate their $250 prize the GivingTuesday area of their choice. The winners were LAS student Rachel Le Comber and UIC Business student Bri Daniel. Le Comber designated her prize to the UIC Women&#8217;s Tennis Scholarship Fund and Daniel gave hers to the College of Business.</p>
<p>IGNITE GivingTuesday was part of a five-year fundraising campaign on campus, called “IGNITE: The Campaign for UIC,” which launched last fall. The campaign’s goal is to raise $750 million over five years to forge the future of education by redefining the student experience, empowering faculty, driving discovery and connecting to communities.</p>

<p>More than 600 people — patients with craniofacial differences and their families — celebrated the holidays with UI Health Craniofacial Center doctors and staff Dec. 8.</p>
<p>Sponsored by the Face the Future Foundation and Star Events, the celebration included food, face painting, temporary glitter tattoos, a photo booth, cookie decorating, dancing, a visit from Santa Claus and gifts.</p>
<p>Dance performances were presented from Ballet Folklorico Sones Mexicanos — a nonprofit that provides children, teens and adults an experience into Mexican culture and traditions by preserving and elevating heritage through the art of dance — and the Extensions Dance Company. Along with event staff, the dancers volunteered their time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today is about celebrating and togetherness,&#8221; said Dr. Mimis Cohen, professor and chief of plastics, reconstructive and cosmetic surgery at the UIC College of Medicine and director of the UI Health Craniofacial Center. &#8220;Kids with craniofacial differences and their families have many complex needs, and we get to know them very well over many years. It is wonderful to spend time together outside the clinic.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UI Health Craniofacial Center is one of the oldest and largest facilities in the world dedicated to the evaluation and treatment of infants, children, adolescents and adults with cleft lip and palate and other craniofacial conditions. A team approach is the hallmark of the center, where medical specialists and health professionals join together to provide interdisciplinary, comprehensive care in a single location.</p>
<p>The event is held annually.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p><a href="https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/12/books2.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-19281 size-medium" src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/12/books2-387x258.jpg" alt="stack of books" width="387" height="258" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/12/books2-387x258.jpg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/12/books2-590x393.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/12/books2-600x400.jpg 600w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/12/books2-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/12/books2-500x333.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/12/books2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/12/books2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /></a>I don’t know if this is just me, but I feel like this transition into finals week has brought my life back into a frenzy. The simple prospect of change and preparation for holidays and a new semester all of the sudden makes me feel like life is starting to move faster around me, yet I am stuck in place.</p>
<p>Everything is changing, academically and in the rest of life. My family just adopted a new dog, and every day my mom sends me new videos of him. I don’t live at home, so I am dying to go home and meet him but, obviously, finals. I am now wrapping up my fifth semester at UIC, I’m halfway through junior year, and I’m over halfway done with college. I’m almost there, but everything is still so unclear.</p>
<p>To be quite honest, I have no idea what I want to do. While I love writing and social justice issues, there are just so many places to go with that. What if I choose the wrong path or make the wrong decision? Where should I try to intern? Will I have enough experience to make it out in the world? There are so many what ifs being stirred up with the ending of this semester. It is not even these next couple of weeks that I am worried about, but it is everything that follows.</p>
<p>“A year ago,<br />
You did not know today.<br />
You did not know<br />
How you’d make it here.<br />
But you made it here.<br />
By grace, you made it here.”</p>
<p>&#8211; Morgan Harper Nichols</p>
<p>I read this poem the other day, and I wanted to share this refreshing thought. Sure, there are a lot of unknowns following this upcoming week. You may be wondering what your grades were, if you will pass, if you will find a new job, if you will get accepted for an internship, if you will ever be able to relax again… take a moment. Breathe. Remember that you have made it this far; you will do it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Writing is how she connects, processes, expresses and relates to the rest of the world. Increasingly aware of the power of storytelling in bringing about change and reform, Abigail earnestly seeks to find a way to incorporate a perfect blend of writing and social work within the criminal justice system — she dreams of bringing about a positive change, one story at a time. At UIC, she is involved in campus ministry; conducts research with the criminology, law and justice department; interns with the Chicago Justice Project, and loves exploring new places downtown. </i></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Fund in UIC alum Tamara O'Neal's name supports research to decrease gun and interpersonal violence]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><div id="attachment_71854" style="width: 268px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Tamara-ONeal.jpg"><img class="wp-image-71854 size-medium" src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Tamara-ONeal-258x258.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="258" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Tamara-ONeal-258x258.jpg 258w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Tamara-ONeal-150x150.jpg 150w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Tamara-ONeal-406x406.jpg 406w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Tamara-ONeal-160x160.jpg 160w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Tamara-ONeal-45x45.jpg 45w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Tamara-ONeal.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tamara O’Neal</p></div>
<p>UIC College of Medicine professor Janet Lin remembers her former student and colleague Tamara O’Neal as a passionate and warm-hearted person.</p>
<p>“She always came to work with a smile on her face,” Lin said about O’Neal, a 2014 MD graduate and 2017 emergency medicine resident graduate from the College of Medicine.</p>
<p>After completing the program, she was an emergency room physician at Mercy Hospital in Chicago, where she also volunteered her time to teach clinical residents before she was shot and killed Nov. 19.</p>
<p>“She would want us to carry forward,” Lin said.</p>
<p>Friends and colleagues are honoring O’Neal’s memory by raising money for a research fund in her name. Their goal is to reach $50,000, an amount that will support the American Foundation for Firearm Injury Reduction in Medicine (AFFIRM), a nonprofit committed to ending gun violence.</p>
<p><a href="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/affirm.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-71853 size-medium" src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/affirm-302x258.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="258" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/affirm-302x258.jpg 302w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/affirm-476x406.jpg 476w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/affirm.jpg 491w" sizes="(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" /></a>Sunil Arora, a UIC emergency medicine faculty member, kicked off the drive for the AFFIRM research fund established in O’Neal’s name. Arora helped raise a total of $24,000 — $11,000 initially and then $13,000 on Giving Tuesday. The Illinois College of Emergency Physicians and the College of Medicine later joined the effort.</p>
<p>“In a little over a week, we have been able to raise more than $36,000, and we are hoping to hit our goal of $50,000 within the next week,” Arora said.</p>
<p>Funds will support research that aims to decrease injuries and deaths caused by firearms and interpersonal violence. Anonymous donors have pledged to match the group’s goal 1-to-1.</p>
<p>“This is something we deal with in the emergency department regularly,” Arora said. “Similar to seat belt laws, speed limits on the highways and other public safety and health initiatives in the past, domestic violence, intimate partner violence and gun violence haven’t received the same level of research money to see how we could make an impact on a preventative basis by decreasing injuries and ultimately deaths.”</p>
<p>The fund will also keep O’Neal’s spirit of doing good alive.</p>
<p>“For us to find a silver lining in horrendous tragic events is something she would want us to do,” Lin said. “To ensure her legacy of what’s good in the world endures. ‘Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.’”</p>
<p>To donate, visit the fundraiser’s <a href="http://bit.ly/TamaraAFFIRM">official Facebook page</a> or visit the <a href="https://affirmresearch.org/tamara-oneal-memorial-research-fund/">AFFIRM website</a>. Donors should include the words “UIC/ICEP” in the optional note section to be included in the matched funds.</p>

<p>The master of city design degree, based in the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, will offer an interdisciplinary learning experience that blends elements of architecture, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning and other creative fields. Students will experience intensive city-based courses and studios that provide immersive exposure to integrated design and contemporary professional practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The master of city design expands the portfolio of degree offerings by the college, reflecting the changing needs of cities and metropolitan regions,&#8221; said Michael Pagano, dean of the college. &#8220;That the degree is offered in the center of a global city makes it an exceptionally attractive program for professionals who are looking to enhance their skill set.&#8221;</p>
<p>Serving as director designate for the program is Sanjeev Vidyarthi, whose own training and professional experience combines architecture, urban design and spatial planning.</p>
<div id="attachment_71305" style="width: 281px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/uic-establishes-new-graduate-degree-in-city-design/sanjeev-vidyarthi-2"><img class="wp-image-71305 size-large" src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/Sanjeev-Vidyarthi-2-271x406.jpg" alt="Sanjeev Vidyarthi" width="271" height="406" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/Sanjeev-Vidyarthi-2-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/Sanjeev-Vidyarthi-2-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/Sanjeev-Vidyarthi-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/Sanjeev-Vidyarthi-2-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/Sanjeev-Vidyarthi-2-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/11/Sanjeev-Vidyarthi-2.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sanjeev Vidyarthi, UIC associate professor of urban planning and policy and director designate of the master of city design program.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;The master of city design program not only showcases the university&#8217;s Great Cities Commitment, but is also well-positioned to produce reflective designers equipped with cutting-edge knowledge and skills to face the complex challenges of an increasingly urban world,&#8221; said Vidyarthi, associate professor of urban planning and policy.</p>
<p>The program will prepare students for career opportunities at planning and design consulting firms and related work with governments, foundations, community organizations and public sector agencies. It will also enable them to gain acceptance to doctoral programs in urban planning and design.</p>
<p>Graduates of the program will be desirable to prospective employers for their &#8220;ability to conceive urban public spaces and civic improvement projects by focusing on the physical design aspects of spatial relationships and interactions between people and places,&#8221; Vidyarthi said.</p>
<p>The program&#8217;s courses will be taught by faculty and urban scholars from UIC research centers such as the Great Cities Institute and Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement, and accomplished practitioners from Chicago&#8217;s leading design firms.</p>
<p>The 38-credit-hour degree can be completed in one year of full-time study. Applications are due Feb. 15 for international applicants and March 15 for domestic applicants. To be considered for a limited number of departmental scholarships, applicants should apply by Jan. 15.</p>
<p>In addition to the new degree, the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs offers two bachelor&#8217;s degrees in urban studies and public policy, along with master&#8217;s and Ph.D. degrees in urban planning and policy as well as public administration. Certificate programs in geospatial analysis and visualization, and public transit planning and management are also available.</p>
<p>More information about the master of city design degree is available <a href="http://bit.ly/2PqwVjU"><strong>online</strong></a> or contact Vidyarthi at svidy@uic.edu or (312) 355-0309.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/la-graduada-dorada-nancy-holmes"><span class="s1">En Español</span></a></p>
<p>Today, about 25 percent of workers in STEM careers — those involving science, technology, engineering and math — are women. But back in 1968, when Nancy Holmes was the first woman to earn a degree in engineering from the UIC College of Engineering, the percentage of women in science or engineering careers was diminishingly small.</p>
<p>For Holmes, who grew up in Oak Park, the probability that she would go into the sciences was high from the start — several uncles and her grandfather were civil engineers, her brother is an architectural engineer, her father was an engineer at Zenith Radio and two aunts had advanced math degrees. Her mother had a job in hospital nutrition and was well-versed in chemistry. So, when her high school dean asked what she wanted to major in for college, she said engineering without hesitation.</p>
<p>She began her freshman year in the fall of 1958 at the Urbana-Champaign campus.</p>
<p>“When classes started, I soon realized that all of my classmates in engineering would be male,” Holmes said. “I wouldn’t be in an engineering class with a female until my last class as a graduate student.”</p>
<p>For the most part, Holmes said, the men in her classes and her teachers treated her with respect.</p>
<p>She married her husband, Tom, in 1959. Soon, they added two daughters to the family, and Holmes spent the next nine years working on her degree while raising her children and participating in suburban life.</p>
<p>From 1959 through 1961, she took classes at the University of Illinois Navy Pier campus. In 1961, she spent six weeks in a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp near Blackduck, Minnesota, for her required course in surveying. She was the only woman in her barracks. She remembers that her male classmates treated her very politely, if formally at first, but later they got along as friendly colleagues.</p>
<p>In 1965, Holmes went back to the UIC campus, which was known then as the Circle Campus, and had just opened. She earned her bachelor’s degree in structural engineering and materials science in 1968, her master’s degree in materials engineering in 1970, and her Ph.D. in engineering in 1976. She was the first woman to earn each of these degrees from the UIC College of Engineering.</p>
<p>She will return to campus Dec. 15 to celebrate with fellow Golden Grads — members of the Class of 1968 — at commencement.</p>
<p>Holmes, 77, worked at Sargent &amp; Lundy, a Chicago engineering firm serving the power industry, from 1976 to 2018. She helped develop computer programs used to determine the magnitude and effects of loads on structures in nuclear and fossil fuel plants caused by earthquakes. She also supervised work on computer programs for soil structure interactions, the generation of response spectra, and analysis of HVAC hangers and piping systems.</p>
<p>Holmes insists that engineering is a great profession for women.</p>
<p>“When I started college, typical choices for women were general liberal arts, teaching, home economics, journalism, and for the very daring, business or science,” she said. “Very few of us expected to have a career. We expected to work a few years and get married and then stay home with the children, but many of us soon discovered that we would be working for some time of our lives. If only more women realized what a challenging and financially rewarding career engineering provides, I think there would be more women in this field.”</p>
<p>Holmes has been an active member of Engineers Without Borders for many years, and has traveled to Guatemala and Honduras to help develop bridges and sanitation systems. She established the Nancy Anderson Holmes scholarship in 2006 in memory of her aunt, which benefits UIC civil engineering students. She received the Legacy Alumni Achievement Award from the UIC College of Engineering in November.</p>
<p>Holmes lives in Oak Park with her husband, Tom. They have three children, 10 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/accidente-de-coche-fija-nuevo-camino-en-la-enfermeria-para-estudiante"><span class="s1">En Español</span></a></p>
<p class="p1">Danielle Wetzel was just about to start college when a car she was riding in fell off a 20-foot cliff.</p>
<p class="p1">Suffering traumatic injuries, she was taken by helicopter to a hospital, where she had several major surgeries and began her long road to recovery.</p>
<p class="p1">“My face was basically smashed,” she said. “I was in the ICU for many weeks, and in the most vulnerable state you can be in. I was afraid that I might die; it wasn’t easy to go through. However, I found so much peace and comfort in the nursing care I received that it changed my whole world.</p>
<p class="p1">“Nursing became my passion, my life’s accomplishments and my future.”</p>
<p class="p1">The incredible care her nurses showed her changed Wetzel’s career trajectory over the past two decades. She shifted her focus from psychology or social work to nursing, finishing her undergraduate studies at the University of Missouri and completing her BSN at Resurrection University.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2014, she joined UIC’s Doctor of Nursing Practice Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Program in the College of Nursing.</p>
<p class="p1">“It was really important to me to not only go to a great school, but I also liked that UIC’s program was so personalized,” she said.</p>
<p class="p1">“They said they understand that you have a busy life and strive to put the program into your life. They lived up to that high standard.”</p>
<p class="p1">Wetzel needed the flexibility to finish her studies. She and her husband, Jason, celebrated the birth of their son, Charlie, who is now almost 3, while Wetzel was a UIC student. She also had a full-time nursing job at Shriners Hospitals for Children, sometimes working 16-hour shifts so she could have a free day to study.</p>
<p class="p1">“I couldn’t have asked for better mentors at UIC, and the teachers cared,” she said. “They were with me the whole way.”</p>
<p class="p1">At Shriners, Wetzel works with children who have faced major traumas or chronic illnesses or conditions. She shares her personal story with them.</p>
<p class="p1">“I tell these kids that I was in an accident that might not be the same as theirs, but I am living the light at the end of the tunnel,” she said.</p>
<p class="p1">“My accident was the worst thing that ever happened to me, but it was also honestly the best thing that ever happened to me because I wouldn’t be doing what I am doing without that happening to me.”</p>
<p class="p1">After she graduates Dec. 15, Wetzel will take her board certification tests and has a job lined up with a primary care office that has locations in Aurora and Oswego. She completed a clinical rotation there, and they were so impressed that they created a nurse practitioner position just for Wetzel.</p>
<p class="p1">“I feel so grateful,” she said.</p>

<p class="p1">Four years ago, Sol Savchuk reset her life.</p>
<p class="p1">Moving to the U.S. from Ukraine, Savchuk fled her war-torn homeland alone to seek asylum.</p>
<p class="p1">“It wasn’t safe for me,” Savchuk said, recalling the violence that led to the 2014 Ukraine Revolution. She helped some of the injured as a medical volunteer.</p>
<p class="p1">But coming to a foreign country forced her to face other fights — ones that threatened her goal of becoming a doctor.</p>
<p class="p1">“As an asylum-seeker, I was not eligible for any federal aid,” said Savchuk, who longed to resume her undergraduate studies in the U.S.</p>
<p class="p1">“Since I didn’t have any family here, I couldn’t have anyone co-sign a loan for me,” she said. “So, there were two years where I really just worked and tried to put together some financial basis for college.”</p>
<p class="p1">In those years, she was promoted in the restaurant where she worked, making her way from barista to service manager. Still, she recalls being discouraged from pursuing her dreams.</p>
<p class="p1">“I remember someone told me that I would never get a medical degree being a first-generation immigrant,” Savchuk said. “They told me it was impossible.”</p>
<p class="p1">And not knowing whether she’d overcome those adversities sometimes took its toll.</p>
<p class="p1">“Those two years of being out of school and not being sure if I’d ever get back on my feet were the most difficult ones,” she said.</p>
<p class="p1">Savchuk did get back on her feet.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2016, she enrolled as an Honors College student at UIC while working almost full time.</p>
<p class="p1">As a student, she majored in neuroscience and assumed leadership roles in organizations like TEDxUIC and the Society for Future Physicians.</p>
<p class="p1">She also worked in research labs. One at UIC explored psychology-related topics of cognition and language. Another at Northwestern University focused on brain cancer and glioblastoma.</p>
<p class="p1">“We work on different techniques, including immunotherapy, stem cell therapy and nanotechnologies,” she said. “We ultimately translate our knowledge to patient care.”</p>
<p class="p1">Her leadership and merits have even helped her win awards and scholarships, including Honors College tuition waivers and the Mark A. Wyatt Memorial Scholarship, which goes to outstanding pre-med students in the sciences.</p>
<p class="p1">“I am so grateful for all of the support,” said Savchuk, adding that she’s learned to stay motivated and determined.</p>
<p class="p1">As Savchuk waits to graduate this December, she’s completing interviews for medical schools.</p>
<p class="p1">“Being so close to what I really want to do in my life, I think before we label something as impossible, we need to just try,” Savchuk said. “Even if it doesn’t work out — maybe I will become something else — but at least I will know that I tried and did my best instead of just giving up.”</p>
