		<description><![CDATA[Ross Edman taught at UIC from 1965 until he retired in 1995]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><div id="attachment_71749" style="width: 281px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/ross-edman-stripes-and-dots"><img class="size-large wp-image-71749" src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Ross-Edman-stripes-and-dots-271x406.jpg" alt="Ross Edman" width="271" height="406" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Ross-Edman-stripes-and-dots-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Ross-Edman-stripes-and-dots-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Ross-Edman-stripes-and-dots-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Ross-Edman-stripes-and-dots-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Ross-Edman-stripes-and-dots-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/Ross-Edman-stripes-and-dots.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ross Edman was a beloved art history professor who died in 2017.</p></div>
<p>For more than 30 years, students attending Ross Edman&#8217;s art history classes at the University of Illinois at Chicago could expect to see him in his signature bow ties, share a laugh at his witty repartee and learn from his expertise in art.</p>
<p>While Edman died in 2017, the beloved teacher made sure that future generations will continue to have the opportunities to share his artistic love and benefit from his role as a mentor by bequeathing nearly $1 million to establish a merit-based award for graduate-level art history students.</p>
<p>The award comes from the estate of Edman, who died at 80, and of his longtime partner, Jon Waltz, who preceded him in death in 2004. The two also left a nearly $1 million bequest to the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, where Waltz also spent three decades as a law school professor.</p>
<p>The UIC award will allow the department of art history to recruit the brightest and most qualified applicants to the program, said Martha Pollak, professor and chair of the department of art history.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that we can offer a named fellowship to a graduate student will raise the visibility of the program,&#8221; Pollak said. &#8220;It means that the future of the graduate program is on even better footing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edman, who was known for his expertise in Asian art, joined UIC in 1965 while the campus was still located at Navy Pier, and taught until 1995. He also served as an Honors College fellow and became an emeritus faculty member after his retirement.</p>
<p>Edman, whose father worked in the U.S. Department of State, spent long periods of time in Europe, where he developed his love of art. He attended Harvard University and earned his master&#8217;s degree in art history from Oberlin College.</p>
<p>In addition to all of the classes he taught over the years, he was the first professor to offer classes on Asian art. His dedication to his students earned him the Silver Circle Award for Excellence in Teaching. He would bring his beloved pair of Pekinese dogs to campus, offering welcome cheer to students and faculty, according to his former colleagues.</p>
<p>While living in Chicago with his partner, Edman became a noted appraiser of art and antiques. He and Waltz later retired to their weekend home in Holland, Michigan, where he loved to garden, cook, read and write long letters to friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;His bequest to the department of art history is only the last expression of his generosity and engagement with our students,&#8221; said Pollak.</p>

(Photo: Jenny Fontaine)</p></div>
<p>The first recipient of the award was Leslie Wooden, who began working this fall on her doctorate in art history with a concentration in gender and women&#8217;s studies. Wooden, who is from Washington, D.C., has two master’s degrees from New York University and a bachelor’s degree from the University of Colorado in Denver.</p>
<p>The award helped her concentrate on her studies and research as she acclimated to the city. She said what made the award especially valuable to her was when she researched Edman and really understood how special he was to his students and to the university.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a great honor to receive this award in my first semester at UIC,&#8221; Wooden said. &#8220;The endowment that Ross Edman and his partner bequeathed is especially significant because UIC is a public institution and this award supports students from all socio-economic backgrounds who like to conduct research but may not have access to outside funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia Miller, an associate professor emerita, who first met Edman in 1977 when she came to UIC as a visiting lecturer, remembers him as a gracious teacher who rewarded good work by his students. Miller, a former chair of the department of art history who retired from the university in 2015, remained in contact with him.</p>
<p>She remembers him as being so dedicated and knowledgeable about Western and Asian art that he would jump in and &#8220;teach everything.&#8221; In addition, he was very supportive of young faculty, especially women at a time when this support was most needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He really genuinely liked the students and liked being with them,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;He was really interested in the students and he was a very good teacher, that’s his main legacy.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Making HIV visible to the immune system]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>A new study suggests that a genetic switch that causes latent HIV inside cells to begin to replicate can be manipulated to completely eradicate the virus from the human body. Cells harboring latent HIV are &#8220;invisible&#8221; to the natural defenses of the immune system.</p>
<p>The findings, which suggest a cure for HIV may be possible, are <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/115/49/12453.short?rss=1">reported</a> in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>During infection, the DNA of HIV makes its way into the host cell’s nucleus and integrates itself into the host genome. The Tat gene circuit is a key piece of HIV DNA that controls the HIV gene transcription and activation. When activated, it initiates a takeover of the cell’s machinery to churn out new copies of the HIV virus, which eventually burst from the cell and infect neighboring cells. HIV-specific immune effector cells kill cells infected with HIV, but only when the cells are being used to produce more of the virus, meaning that the Tat gene circuit is switched on. In cells that are latently infected, the Tat gene circuit is off, and the cell goes about its normal business all the while harboring quiescent HIV.</p>
<p>&#8220;By targeting the Tat gene circuit with drugs or small molecules to activate it, we would be able to cause latently-infected cells to start producing more virus, and then they can be destroyed by the immune system,&#8221; said Jie Liang, the Richard and Loan Hill Professor of Bioengineering in the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Engineering and a lead author of the paper. So far, there are no drugs successfully targeting this circuit.</p>
<p>People infected with the HIV virus can live relatively normal lives with exceedingly low or even undetectable viral loads thanks to powerful antiretroviral therapies that work to suppress viral replication. But even in people where the virus is undetectable, it doesn’t mean it’s completely absent. The HIV virus can hide in cells in an inactivated state, meaning it isn’t actively replicating.</p>
<p>This is a dire situation and makes life-long antiretroviral therapy the only option for HIV infected patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is extremely difficult to flush latently-infected cells out of their latency,&#8221; Liang said.</p>
<p>Techniques developed to reactivate latent HIV-infected cells so that they become susceptible to the body’s natural immune response or to drug therapies have had mixed results — mostly because the technique, known as &#8220;shock and kill,&#8221; relies on a class of drugs called HDAC inhibitors that come with severe adverse effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to better understand the mechanisms that regulate HIV latency so we can identify new opportunities for intervention and develop better drugs that can either lock viral particles in a latent state, or kill latent cells, or both,&#8221; Liang said.</p>
<p>The Tat gene circuit has a random probability of being active or inactive, and the switch from inactive to active can happen spontaneously. &#8220;In HIV-infected cells, reactivation of the Tat gene circuit is still a very rare event,&#8221; Liang said.</p>
<p>Liang and his colleagues developed advanced computational algorithms to study the Tat gene circuit under different conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using different models and algorithms, we were able to accurately map a ‘probability landscape’ of the cellular reactions that can impact Tat gene circuit reactivation, and our results suggest new ways of targeting latent cells that may lead to the eradication of the HIV virus from a host,&#8221; Liang said.</p>
<p>Liang and his colleagues identified ways to manipulate the Tat gene circuit so that the &#8220;shock and kill&#8221; technique would be more effective. They also looked at a &#8220;block and lock&#8221; strategy, where latent viral particles are locked into latency by permanently blocking activation of the Tat gene circuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our results suggest that by controlling HIV latency through manipulation of the Tat gene circuit, effective therapeutic strategies can be identified that would one day provide a cure for HIV,&#8221; Liang said.</p>
<p>Liang and Youfang Cao of Merck Research Laboratories are the lead authors of the study. Xue Lei from the University of Illinois at Chicago; and Alan S. Perelson and Ruy M. Ribeiro from the Los Alamos National Laboratory are the collaborators and co-authors on the paper.</p>
<p>This research was supported in part by contract DE-AC52-06NA5396 from the U.S. Department of Energy; grants R01-CA204962, R01-GM126558, R01-AI028433 and R01-OD011095 from the National Institutes of Health; and by the Center for Nonlinear Studies at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Detecting disease from a drop of cerebrospinal fluid]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The wonders of graphene are numerous — it can enable flexible electronic components, enhance solar cell capacity, filter the finest subatomic particles and revolutionize batteries. Now, the &#8220;supermaterial&#8221; may one day be used to test for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS — a progressive, neurodegenerative disease which is diagnosed mostly by ruling out other disorders, according to new research from the University of Illinois at Chicago <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.8b15893">published</a> in ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces.</p>
<div id="attachment_71709" style="width: 397px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/ALS-Detection-1-new.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-71709" src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/ALS-Detection-1-new-387x258.jpg" alt="ALS Detection" width="387" height="258" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/ALS-Detection-1-new-387x258.jpg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/ALS-Detection-1-new-768x512.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/ALS-Detection-1-new-590x393.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/ALS-Detection-1-new-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/ALS-Detection-1-new-500x333.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/ALS-Detection-1-new-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2018/12/ALS-Detection-1-new-1320x880.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">How graphene can be used to detect ALS biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid. (Credit: Berry Research Laboratory, UIC)</p></div>
<p>When cerebrospinal fluid from patients with ALS was added to graphene, it produced a distinct and different change in the vibrational characteristics of the graphene compared to when fluid from a patient with multiple sclerosis was added or when fluid from a patient without neurodegenerative disease was added to graphene. These distinct changes accurately predicted what kind of patient the fluid came from &#8211; one with ALS, MS or no neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p>Graphene is a single-atom-thick material made up of carbon. Each carbon atom is bound to its neighboring carbon atoms by chemical bonds. The elasticity of these bonds produces resonant vibrations, also known as phonons, which can be very accurately measured. When a molecule interacts with graphene, it changes these resonant vibrations in a very specific and quantifiable way.</p>
<p>“Graphene is just one atom thick, so a molecule on its surface in comparison is enormous and can produce a specific change in graphene’s phonon energy, which we can measure,” said Vikas Berry, associate professor and head of chemical engineering in the UIC College of Engineering and an author on the paper. Changes in graphene’s vibrational characteristics depend on the unique electronic characteristics of the added molecule, known as its &#8220;dipole moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We can determine the dipole moment of the molecule added to graphene by measuring changes in graphene’s phonon energy caused by the molecule,” Berry explained.</p>
<p>Berry and his colleagues used graphene to identify whether the cerebrospinal fluid was from a patient with ALS or multiple sclerosis — two progressive neurodegenerative disorders — or from someone without neurodegenerative disease. Since there is no definitive test for ALS, an objective diagnostic test would help patients start receiving treatment sooner to slow the disease.</p>

<p>Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center, which banks fluid and tissue from deceased individuals. Berry, Dr. Ankit Mehta, assistant professor of neurosurgery and director of spinal oncology in the UIC College of Medicine, and their colleagues tested the cerebrospinal fluid from seven people without neurodegenerative disease; from 13 people with ALS; from three people with multiple sclerosis and from three people with an unknown neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p>“We saw unique and distinct changes in graphene’s phonon energies depending on whether the fluid was from someone with ALS, multiple sclerosis or someone without neurodegenerative disease,” Berry said. “We were also able to determine whether the fluid was from someone over age 55 or younger than 55 when we tested cerebrospinal fluid from ALS patients. We think the difference we see between older and younger ALS patients is driven by unique biochemical signatures we are picking up that correlate to inherited ALS, which usually produces symptoms before age 55, and what’s known as sporadic ALS which occurs later in life.”</p>
<p>Berry believes the graphene is picking up on the unique biosignatures — combinations of proteins, and other biomolecules — present in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with different diseases.</p>
<p>“The electronic properties of graphene have been extensively studied, but only recently have we begun to examine its phononic properties as a way to detect diseases,” Berry said. “And it turns out that graphene is an extremely versatile and accurate detector of biosignatures of diseases found both in cerebrospinal fluids and whole cells.”</p>
<p>Bijentimala Keisham from the UIC College of Engineering; Steven Denyer, Pouyan Kheirkhan, Gregory Arnone, Abhiraj Bhimani and Dr. Ankit Mehta, from the department of neurosurgery in the UIC College of Medicine, Akop Seksenyan from the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, Chicago, and Clive Svendsen from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, are co-authors on the paper.</p>
<p>This research was funded by grant N00014-18-2583 from the Office of Naval Research, grant CMMI-1503681 from the National Science Foundation and a University of Illinois at Chicago Seed Grant.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[UIC study shows sex-related differences in outcomes among CKD patients]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago have found that men with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, are more likely to experience disease progression and death when compared with women suffering from the same condition.</p>
<p>CKD affects more than 26 million people in the United States. People with the condition experience gradual loss of kidney function. In severe cases or when left untreated, CKD causes kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a transplant for survival.</p>
<p>The study, which is <a href="https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/early/2018/12/02/ASN.2018030296">published</a> in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, included nearly 4,000 individuals — 1,778 women and 2,161 men — who were enrolled in the ongoing, multicenter <a href="http://www.cristudy.org/Chronic-Kidney-Disease/Chronic-Renal-Insufficiency-Cohort-Study/">Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study</a>.</p>
<p>The UIC researchers analyzed the incidence of end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) trends — a key marker of kidney health — and death, and compared them by sex.</p>
<p>At a median follow-up of seven years, the rate of ESRD per 100 people was 3.1 in women and 3.8 in men. The corresponding rates of death were 2.6 and 3.6, respectively.</p>
<div id="attachment_58161" style="width: 182px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/men-with-chronic-kidney-disease-have-worse-outcomes-than-women/2017-ricardo-ana11_new"><img class="wp-image-58161 size-medium" src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2017/08/2017.Ricardo.Ana11_new-172x258.jpg" alt="Ana Ricardo; experts guide" width="172" height="258" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2017/08/2017.Ricardo.Ana11_new-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2017/08/2017.Ricardo.Ana11_new-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2017/08/2017.Ricardo.Ana11_new-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2017/08/2017.Ricardo.Ana11_new-600x900.jpg 600w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2017/08/2017.Ricardo.Ana11_new-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2017/08/2017.Ricardo.Ana11_new-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2017/08/2017.Ricardo.Ana11_new.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Ana Ricardo (Photo: Jenny Fontaine)</p></div>
<p>&#8220;We found that women had 17 percent lower risk of experiencing ESRD and the risk of death was 31 percent lower in women than in men,&#8221; said Dr. Ana Ricardo, lead author of the study.</p>
<p>These differences persisted after adjustments for observed sex-related disparities in lifestyle and medical management, and after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, baseline kidney function, medications, and cardiovascular and metabolic factors.</p>
<p>Ricardo said the findings were particularly striking, as they observed men were more likely to be on kidney-protective medications.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve known for a long time that women are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, but there has been conflicting research on CKD outcomes by sex,&#8221; said Ricardo, associate professor of medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine. &#8220;This is the first study to analyze data from a large, representative sample of prospectively enrolled patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;The results of this study suggest that biology and psychosocial factors may be the driver of the sex-related disparity observed in patients with CKD,&#8221; Ricardo said.</p>
<p>Ricardo hopes the study increases public and care provider awareness of the higher risk of kidney failure and death among men.</p>
<p>Funding for the CRIC Study was obtained under a cooperative agreement from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (U01DK060990, U01DK060984, U01DK061022, U01DK061021, U01DK061028, U01DK060980, U01DK060963 and U01DK060902). Additional funding to individual researchers was noted in the study.</p>
<p>Co-authors on the study from UIC are Anjella Manoharan, Dr. Martha Daviglus and Dr. James Lash.</p>
<p>Additional co-authors are Wei Yang and Daohang Sha of the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Lawrence Appel of Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Jing Chen and Dr. Marie Krousel-Wood of Tulane University, Dr. Susan Steigerwalt of the University of Michigan, Dr. Jackson Wright and Dr. Mahboob Rahman of Case Western University, Dr. Sylvia Rosas of Harvard Medical School, Dr. Milda Saunders of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kumar Sharma of the University of California and CRIC Study investigators.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[More crime more seizures]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>People with epilepsy living in high crime neighborhoods in Chicago had three times as many seizures as those living in neighborhoods with lower crime rates, according to new research from the University of Illinois at Chicago presented at the American Epilepsy Society 2018 conference in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder characterized by abnormal brain activity and seizures, affects more than 65 million people worldwide. About one-third have difficulty controlling their seizures even with medication. Seizures can interfere with work, relationships and the ability to live independently. Previous research has shown that living in neighborhoods with high rates of crime have significantly higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Stress is also a factor that is commonly reported to trigger seizures in people with epilepsy.</p>
<p>The UIC study included 63 adults with epilepsy living within the city limits of Chicago who were participating in a larger study testing the efficacy of a tablet-based educational tool that provides tailored information about epilepsy. That study, called PAUSE, involves patients at the University of Illinois Hospital’s epilepsy clinic and in the Chicagoland community and is facilitated by the Epilepsy Foundation of Greater Chicago.</p>
<p>The researchers determined the levels of crime in neighborhoods of the 63 participants by mapping their ZIP codes to specific neighborhoods and then cross-referencing those neighborhoods with local crime rates available through the City of Chicago Police data portal. Participants self-reported the number of seizures they had in the past month and in the past three months.</p>
<p>“We found that people living with epilepsy who live in high-crime neighborhoods experienced significantly more seizures,” said Jessica Levy, a research coordinator in the UIC department of neurology and rehabilitation who presented the findings. “On average, people in high-crime neighborhoods had three seizures versus one for people living in low-crime neighborhoods when we looked back over the last 30 days. Over the course of 90 days, people in high-crime neighborhoods had seven seizures on average compared to three for those living in low-crime neighborhoods, so the link between crime and seizure activity is significant.”</p>
<p>The researchers found no overall association between neighborhood crime status and the duration of epilepsy or between crime status and poverty.</p>
<p>Having more seizures can significantly lower quality of life. Seizures that result in falls can cause bruising or even broken bones. There can also be a stigma associated with having a seizure in public.</p>
<p>“Understanding the impact of violence and crime as potential triggers for seizures underscores the need for further research that might allow clinicians to make better-informed recommendations for self-management education and stress management skills,” said Dr. Dilip Pandey, associate professor of neurology and rehabilitation at UIC and an investigator on the study.</p>
<p>Katharine Ozenberger is a co-investigator on the study.</p>
<p>The PAUSE study is conducted through the UIC department of neurology and rehabilitation by Dr. Dilip Pandey and Dr. Jeffery Loeb.</p>
<p>PAUSE is supported by the University of Illinois Prevention Research Center and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW) Network under CDC cooperative agreement no. U48-DP005010. UIC IRB # 2015-0595.</p>

<p>A University of Illinois at Chicago assistant professor has received a $100,000 grant to continue her work challenging the &#8220;demonization, warehousing and social exclusion of people&#8221; in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Laurie Jo Reynolds received a “Changing Narratives Through Art” grant from the Art for Justice Fund for her project on Illinois housing banishment policies. Those are laws that restrict where people may live after a criminal conviction.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://artforjusticefund.org/">Art for Justice Fund</a> was created by Agnes Gund, a philanthropist and art collector, who used proceeds from the sale of a multimillion dollar painting to start the fund with the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors.</p>
<p>A component of this project is to compile stories of families experiencing homelessness and housing instability, Reynolds said. Through audio recordings, people describe the steps they must go through to comply with laws, hold down a job while meeting those requirements, and ultimately find a place to sleep.</p>
<p>Reynolds and volunteers have been going to Chicago police headquarters at dawn to meet with people who must re-register weekly because they lack a fixed address. People often wait for hours to register, arriving as early as four and five hours before the station opens to get a place in line.</p>
<p>“Technically, it is illegal for some of these guys to wait outside the police station, because it is across the street from a school and therefore within a public exclusion zone,” said Reynolds, adding that failing to register is a felony.</p>
<p>Reynolds, who joined UIC in 2015, said her project has developed collaboratively with people experiencing homelessness due to housing banishment laws and public conviction registries.</p>
<p>“We all want policies that promote true public safety,” Reynolds said. “But these laws drive people with homes into homelessness and people with jobs into unemployment, which is a damaging role for state government to be playing in the lives of formerly convicted people.”</p>
<p>Illinois has five state registries, which are police websites that publish personal data about people with past convictions, Reynolds said. The rules and reporting requirements have grown increasingly complex, leading to extended registration time and new incarcerations for technical violations. People on registry lists must go to police stations to re-register yearly, quarterly or weekly if they are homeless.</p>
<p>“It’s hard enough to keep a job while homeless, but no employer will let you take off one day a week to go to the police to re-register,” Reynolds said.</p>

<p>Most people with sex offense convictions are subject to housing banishment laws for life, even if they get off the registry. They cannot reside within 500 feet of a school, playground, child care center, home day care or any location providing programs exclusively to minors<strong>. </strong>“Taken together, these zones render nearly all housing illegal,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Even the Illinois Department of Corrections, or IDOC, can’t find housing for parolees leaving prison, she added. For the past decade, an average of 1,200 people remained incarcerated because of the housing shortage &#8220;manufactured&#8221; by state laws and parole requirements. Only once people finish their “parole time” in prison can they be released, and for many that means homelessness.</p>
<p>Reynolds, a policy advocate, has a long history working on criminal justice issues, focusing on the most extreme policies inside and outside of prison. She was the organizer of Tamms Year Ten, a grassroots legislative campaign to close Illinois’ notorious state “Supermax” prison, which former Gov. Pat Quinn shuttered in 2013. She was also in the 2010 work group convened by IDOC to address this housing shortage.</p>
<p>In 2016, Reynolds convened a conference at the UIC Jane Addams Hull-House Museum and Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, &#8220;The Registry 20 Years Later: Addressing Unintended Consequences,&#8221; to bring together justice advocates, victim advocates, service providers, faith leaders and elected officials to examine how these laws debilitate families, driving them into housing instability, unemployment and poverty<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Last year, Reynolds was one of seven international artists invited to present a commissioned work at a summit entitled, &#8220;What is An Artistic Practice of Human Rights?&#8221; Her performance, “A True Person of No Status,” featured testimony from people on registries, advocates, and service providers, along with comedy and dramatic re-enactment, before an onstage audience. She also organized, with rape victim advocate Lynne Johnson, a policy symposium titled, “We Should Not Have Policies We are Afraid to Talk About,” which presented case studies about the impact of these laws, followed by dialogue between legislators, state officials and victim advocates.</p>
<p>The Art for Justice grant will help this growing alliance seek more pragmatic policies. Given that 47 percent of Illinois adults have some criminal record, these laws impact people at high rates and have disproportionate racial outcomes, she said. For example, one in every 227 men in Illinois is on the sex offense registry. For African-American men, this rate is one in 100, according to Reynolds.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Reynolds was one of only eight people internationally to receive the inaugural <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/press-releases/open-society-foundations-announce-inaugural-soros-arts-fellows">Soros Arts Fellowship</a> by the Open Society Foundations and received an $80,000 stipend to support this project. Essential to this work is building community partnerships to advocate for policies that prevent victimization, support survivors and allow people to lead positive and productive lives after a conviction.</p>
<p>“We have to let people move on,” Reynolds said.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Modeling life on Titan in the lab]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The University of Illinois at Chicago has received a $1.1 million, five-year grant from NASA’s Astrobiology Institute to identify biosignatures of life on Titan — Saturn’s largest moon — from either currently living or long-extinct life. Titan’s ocean, which sits below a thick ice layer, is believed to have conditions favorable to life.</p>
<p>The project, led by researchers in UIC’s department of earth and environmental sciences, is one of several national research initiatives focused on answering key questions related to the astrobiology of our solar system: what do other habitable environments look like, what kinds of organisms might have lived in these environments, and what biosignatures — chemical or molecular &#8220;fossils&#8221; indicative of current or previous life — should we look for?</p>

<p>Until the NASA Cassini mission — which in 2005 sent a small spacecraft on several data-collecting flybys of Titan before it landed on the moon’s surface, where it collected and transmitted data back to Earth — little was known about Titan except that it had a hazy, nitrogen-rich atmosphere. Cassini revealed that Titan has seas of liquid methane and ethane, replenished by rain from hydrocarbon clouds. The mission also provided evidence that Titan has an ocean made up of water beneath a global water ice sheet that is estimated to be as much as 80 kilometers thick.</p>
<p>Life on Titan would have to exist under extremely harsh conditions. This project considers the potential for life in Titan’s ocean, where the temperature ranges from -20 to 10 degrees Celsius and pressures reach 2,000 to 8,000 atmospheres, up to eight times the pressure measured under 11 km of seawater at the deepest point of Earth’s ocean.</p>
<p>“The essential chemical building blocks for life are present in the atmosphere, but Titan’s surface is quite inhospitable to life as we know it because of its extremely low temperature, ‑180 C and the absence of liquid water,” said Fabien Kenig, professor of earth and environmental sciences at UIC and one of the principal investigators on the grant.</p>
<p>“We believe life on Titan would have formed using atmospheric chemical building blocks that entered the oceans through processes like convection or interactions of liquid water with the moon’s rocky core. The ocean and the ocean floor are much more habitable, supportive environments for life than Titan’s frigid surface.”</p>
<p>Scientists generally agree that life in Titan’s ocean would be microbial (small size, single-cell organisms).</p>

<p>“Life on Titan most likely would have inhabited the ocean, where organisms would have given off metabolic waste products and potentially even left fragments,” said D’Arcy Meyer-Dombard, associate professor of earth and environmental sciences at UIC and co-principal investigator on the grant. “Some of these biosignatures would eventually be transported to the ice sheet above, and possibly through the ice sheet back to the surface and possibly the atmosphere by geological processes, but we need to know what signatures to look for.”</p>
<p>The biosignatures would be detected using instruments that could be sent to orbit or land on the surface of Titan in the future.</p>
<p>Meyer-Dombard and Kenig will re-create conditions found in Titan’s ocean in the laboratory, grow microorganisms under these conditions (high pressure, extreme cold), and look for characteristic chemical and biological signatures that could help other researchers detect and identify life, or traces of extinct life forms on Titan and beyond.</p>
<p>To mimic the deep underwater zone where life is believed to have most likely existed if it did, Meyer-Dombard and Kenig will re-create the conditions of Titan’s ocean in the laboratory. To do so they must construct and maintain a growth chamber at approximately -15 C at extremely high pressure. Pressures on Titan are two to eight times higher than previously explored life-supporting environments on Earth. They will use different kinds of microorganisms such as strains of the bacteria <em>Moritella</em> or Archaea, <em>Pyrococcus</em> as model Titan life forms to grow in the chamber, but these organisms will have to be trained to grow at very high pressure. They will also use organisms found in environments on Earth that are &#8220;analog&#8221; environments to those on Titan.</p>
<p>Because of the intense high pressure and extremely low temperatures, the microorganisms will grow and divide very slowly. The researchers anticipate leaving the microorganisms in the chamber for several years, occasionally — and very carefully — siphoning off a small sample of cells to examine.</p>
<p>“Because of the high pressure, we need to be very careful with this chamber, especially when we are going in to collect samples,&#8221; Kenig said.</p>
<p>Kenig and Meyer-Dombard have a few ideas for the design of the growth chamber, which they estimate will be about the size of a ping-pong ball. These kinds of experiments have never been attempted before.</p>
<p>Kenig and Meyer-Dombard believe that the microorganisms they grow in their chamber will exhibit alterations in gene expression as well as membrane morphology and composition.</p>
<p>“The high pressure could cause changes in the cell membrane that enable it to remain fluid and flexible under such high pressure — specifically, the lipids in the membrane could become shortened. If we know what these high-pressure induced changes look like, we can look for them in samples that may be collected one day on Titan or on other similar moons or planets,” Kenig said.</p>
