				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>The European Union (EU) <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018. The purpose of the GDPR is to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe and strengthen data privacy protections for persons in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">European Economic Area (EEA)</a>. The GDPR may also protect the personal data of persons located outside the EEA under certain circumstances. The GDPR carries the potential for significant fines for noncompliance. Learn more about the GDPR <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en">here</a>.</p>
<p>The GDPR affects how and what <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-personal-data_en">personal data</a> can be collected about individuals, including information collected for research purposes. The University of Illinois System has already implemented a <a href="https://www.vpaa.uillinois.edu/resources/web_privacy/supplemental_web_privacy_notice">Supplemental Privacy Notice</a> explaining how the University processes personal information covered by the GDPR. UIC has also enhanced website disclosures on priority websites where cookies are used, and assessments pertaining to how the GDPR affects research are currently in progress.</p>
<p>The UIC Office for the Protection of Research Subjects is currently polling investigators to identify active research studies that may be affected by the GDPR. If you are a UIC investigator who is currently conducting research that involves or will involve any of the following, please click <a href="https://uic.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Lf4giNpF5FoI8B"><strong>here</strong></a> to complete a brief questionnaire:</p>
<ol>
<li>Primary data will be collected from persons physically located in the EEA;</li>
<li>Secondary data will be obtained from an entity in the EEA about individuals located anywhere in the world;</li>
<li>Data will be scraped from accounts or websites of persons or entities in the EEA;</li>
<li>Collaborating researchers/parties in the EEA are providing their personal data; or,</li>
<li>Personal data collected in 1-4 will be shared outside UIC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Responses to this poll will only be used by OPRS staff to contact you for follow-up, if needed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:</p>
<p>On November 15, 2018, the University of Illinois Board of Trustees approved the UIC Master Plan Update: 2018 Implementation Plan.  This exciting plan will carry the University’s positive momentum into and through the next decade with a solid foundation for growth.  I would encourage all of you to watch the following 5-minute <a href="https://cppm.uic.edu/videos/master_plan1.mp4">video</a>, which captures the essence of the 2018 Implementation Plan.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the University has a proud heritage of embracing and planning for the future.  In 2016, UIC articulated its Strategic Priorities to build on these strengths.  It outlined a plan to enhance student support and fortify the University’s national and global reputation. The document, “Leveraging Our Strengths to Shape the Future,” highlights four strategic areas that define an outstanding global research university:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student Experience and Success</li>
<li>National and International Impact and Visibility</li>
<li>Chicago and Community Engagement</li>
<li>Entrepreneurial University</li>
</ul>
<p>These priorities, as well as UIC’s rapidly growing student enrollment and evolving educational, research and health care needs all place great demands on the University’s physical facilities and infrastructure.  In fact, the strength of UIC’s enrollment momentum alone creates an urgent need to address the various space requirements for the success of our students and the staff that support them.</p>
<p>The 2018 Implementation Plan is a compelling vision for changing and growing our physical infrastructure in a way that will enable the continued upward trajectory of UIC’s academic and health care programs.  It is a multifaceted plan for implementing the Strategic Priorities that embraces change and was developed from the following guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drive Excellence</strong>: Build appropriate environments to support academic and health care programs</li>
<li><strong>Enhance Identify</strong>: Create a welcoming setting that encourages people to linger</li>
<li><strong>Our Campus is Chicago</strong>: Connect people and the campus to the City</li>
<li><strong>Transform UIC</strong>: Leverage campus heritage and change the physical paradigm to appeal to all</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2018 Implementation Plan is a bold, visionary and achievable plan that supports the UIC mission of teaching, research, public service and health care.  Please visit the <a href="http://masterplan.uic.edu">UIC master plan website</a> to read the executive summary, the full report and see the map of the future UIC campus.</p>
<p>Michael D. Amiridis<br />
Chancellor</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Faculty and Staff,</p>
<p>This weekend will be a very special one for our entire University family. Earlier this month Credit Union 1 secured the naming rights to the UIC Pavilion, pending approval of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees. The company has made a commitment of more than $9 million over 15 years. In addition to the naming rights, Credit Union 1 will be giving $750,000 toward scholarships at the University.</p>
<p>We will commemorate this significant moment in UIC history this weekend, and Athletics invites you and your family to celebrate with us. We have a full day of basketball at Credit Union 1 Arena on Saturday, December 1, beginning at 11 a.m., when our women’s team hosts Miami (Ohio). Later, the men’s squad welcomes crosstown rival Loyola at 3:12 p.m. for the first visit by a men’s basketball Final Four team to our campus since 2012. This is a unique chance for us to show our city and the world what we are all about.</p>
<p>UIC Faculty and Staff can purchase tickets for 50% off by using offer code &#8220;STAFF10&#8221; at <a href="http://bit.ly/UICvsLoyola">bit.ly/UICvsLoyola</a>. The ticket will be honored for both basketball games.</p>
<p>And if you’re worried about how to fill the time in between games? Don’t be because there will be a FREE tailgate with food and drink in the parking lot across the street at the corner of Racine and Harrison from 1-2:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Please join Athletics and come out to Credit Union 1 Arena on Saturday to cheer on your Flames. Let’s show our collective appreciation to our partners at Credit Union 1 for their reinforced pledge to this institution and it&#8217;s sustained success.</p>
<p>Fire Up Flames,</p>

<p>UIC will continue normal operations today.</p>
<p>While we realize that weather differs across the Chicagoland area, conditions in the city and on campus are wet but accessible.</p>
<p>All employees are urged to use their discretion in deciding whether they can safely commute to and from campus. If personal safety or health is an issue in that decision, responsible judgment should be used. Employees who cannot report to work must use personal time (vacation, floating holiday, accrued comp time) or take an excused, unpaid absence.</p>
<p>As a reminder, please call the 24/7 phone number, 5-SNOW (312-355-7669) to report any snow- or ice-related problems on campus.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Members of the Campus Community,</p>
<p>The impending winter weather conditions call for heavy snow this evening through tomorrow morning, Nov. 26. We are preparing for the storm and will closely watch the forecast from the US National Weather Service in Chicago.</p>
<p>At this point, we are waiting for additional information before a decision is made regarding a delayed opening or a cancellation of certain university functions. We are committed to the safety and well-being of our employees and students and we will assess the situation throughout the evening and early morning hours. A decision will be communicated by 6:00 a.m. Monday.</p>
<p>In the event of any changes to university operations, the campus community may be notified by SMS/text message, email, social media and alerts posted to the <a href="http://uic.edu/">UIC.edu</a> homepage. The residential, health care and research aspects of UIC operations make it impossible to close the entire campus. The hospital will continue normal operations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>The Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research is delighted by the campus response to the UIC DPI Seed Funding Program. This funding opportunity, as previously announced, leverages up to $10 million from UIC’s royalty revenue as “seed funds” to align new UIC research activities with the DPI mission and priorities. Information on DPI can be found at <a href="https://dpi.uillinois.edu/">https://dpi.uillinois.edu/.</a></p>
<p>Two cycles of funding were announced in October. Due to a strong response to Cycle 1 and a large volume of letter of intent (LOIs) submitted for Cycle 2, we are extending the deadline for Cycle 2 applications.</p>
<p><strong>DPI Seed Funding Cycle 2 proposals will be due no later than 5:00 pm Central Time on Friday, January 18, 2019.</strong></p>
<p>Please visit the DPI Seed Program page for additional information and FAQs at <a href="http://research.uic.edu/uicdpi">http://research.uic.edu/uicdpi</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>The ACCC Information Security and Privacy Office has been receiving many reports of directed email scams targeting UIC faculty and staff in an attempt to get the recipient to purchase gift cards and to email the gift card numbers to the attacker.</p>
<p>If you receive such a message, DO NOT RESPOND.</p>
<p>In these attacks, UIC faculty and staff are sent email pretending to be from university leaders, typically deans, directors, or department heads. The emails arrive from random email addresses that are sometimes crafted to trick the recipient at first glance but are not really from a UIC.EDU address. For example, the email may arrive from “bobgreen.uic.edu@gmail.com” or “bobgreen@xyz.com” but not from “bobgreen@uic.edu”. The name of the person sending the email is changed to the name of the university leader (e.g. “Bob Green”). Sometimes the sender is hoping that the recipient will not notice that the email is not from UIC but in other cases it has purported to be from the leader’s personal email account.</p>
<p>The end goal of the emails appears to be to convince unsuspecting staff to purchase gift cards on the “leader’s behalf” and email the codes to them with the promise of later reimbursement.</p>
<p>The email attacks that we have been seeing sometimes begin with an email such as “Are you available?” and if someone responds, the attacker posing as the leader explains that they are caught in a meeting, can’t take calls and need the recipient to buy gift cards for them and will reimburse them later.</p>
<p>Other attacks have had the “please buy gift cards for me” message included in the first wave.</p>
<p>Due to the use of random senders and the commonplace text in the emails of these attacks, ACCC is unable to prevent them without blocking legitimate email.</p>
<p>Again, if you receive such a message, do not respond. If you are in doubt, contact the person who is supposedly sending the email by campus phone before taking any action as directed.</p>
<p>If you received email of this form and purchased gift cards, please contact the UIC Police for assistance. For information on how to contact the UIC Police, please visit <a href="http://police.uic.edu">police.uic.edu</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Attackers have been targeting the UIC student community with emails advertising fake job opportunities. In particular, emails with the subject &#8220;Your UIC Job Application (Administrative Coordinating Assistant)&#8221; are part of a scam designed to trick students into sending money to the attackers.</p>
<p>In this type of scam, the attacker (email sender) requests the name, phone number, and postal/email addresses of people who respond to the email wanting to make extra cash. Once interest is expressed, the attacker follows-up with a phone call. The caller then proceeds to instruct the responder to deposit checks in their personal bank account. Once the check is deposited, the victim is instructed to purchase gift cards and send the card numbers of the associated gift cards to the listed email address.</p>
<p>This is a common scam in which the scam artists attempt to get a person to deposit a fraudulent check into their bank account, realizing that many banks will allow you to receive cash back before the usual 3 day processing period. After the 3 day processing period, the bank notifies the account holder that the check was fraudulent and the account holder loses funds and is often held responsible for re-payment of the amounts already sent to the attacker.</p>
<p>This particular scam was designed to appear as if it was a university sponsored job that required one hour a day, 3 days a week, paying $620 weekly.</p>
<p>For security reasons, we are not including the text of the email scam in this notice, but indicators that this email is a scam:<br />
• Unusually high pay<br />
• Employer is unable to meet in-person due to being out of the country<br />
• Poor spelling, grammar and punctuation<br />
• Dubious job activities: “help me Mail letters, Make payments at Walmart and purchase some Items when needed.”<br />
• Requests a reply with Full name, Residential Address, and personal email<br />
• Scrutinize the email address to see who sent it.</p>
<p>As always, individuals are advised to scrutinize unsolicited email for signs that it may be an attack or scam before replying with information or clicking on links.</p>
<p>If you received this email and responded with your information, please contact the UIC Police for assistance. For information on how to contact the UIC Police, please visit police.uic.edu.</p>
