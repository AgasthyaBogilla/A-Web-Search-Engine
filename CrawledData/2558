				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Check out this exciting new online resource created for students to explore their majors in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences:</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://career.las.uic.edu/explore-my-major-pages/">Explore My Major</a></strong> is a new comprehensive LAS online major exploratory resource which highlights each liberal arts major through several categories of: alumni career highlights, unique skills and competencies of each major, industry pathways, current student testimonials with PDF downloads, and unique content and career exploration related website links.</p>
<p>The intention of this resource is to expand the perception of our students of the application and strong value of each liberal arts major.</p>
<p>The hope is that these webpages will be used and integrated into our existing programming as well as shared by academic advisors in advising sessions.  Each page is hyperlinked to a department website so that students will be encouraged to take a deeper review of the major, faculty, and other department resources.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>As you are aware the well-being of UIC students is a top priority, particularly as our students face end of semester demands, and we would like to take this time to once again acknowledge all your efforts as a faculty or staff member in assisting our students who may be experiencing problems and need assistance.  UIC provides a network of support for our students which is not possible without each of you.</p>
<p>The Counseling Center and Dean of Students Office are resources to provide consultation about how best to respond to a student of concern and for the referral of distressed students.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>New Higher Education Course for Spring 2019  &#8211; EDPS 594 &#8220;Student, Diversity, Equity, and Access in Urban Higher Education&#8221; <a href="https://uofi.box.com/s/bqtzjx0mqikz66wzrv6tilol32cg1ihw">Download the flyer to share! </a></em></p>
<p>See the update below on the new M.Ed. in Urban Higher Education:</p>
<p>The M.Ed. in Urban Higher Education proposal was approved by the Educational Policy Studies department, and this fall the proposal was approved by the College of Education Educational Programs and Policy Committee. The proposal will now move through the approval process at the UIC campus, University, and Illinois Board of Higher Education levels.  If approved at all levels, we plan to admit our first class of M.Ed. in Urban Higher Education students in the Fall semester of 2019.</p>
<p>The M.Ed. in Urban Higher Education is a 36-hour program that has a 20 hour set of core required courses.  The program’s urban focus will give it a unique perspective in comparison with leading programs throughout the country.  This program will explore issues within the academy related to, and informed by, the urban context.  Given the program’s urban and leadership focus, six key themes guide the program:</p>
<ul>
<li>The urban context is key and underscores an emphasis on specific complex challenges and opportunities</li>
<li>Building and maintaining equity and authentic diversity in higher education is essential</li>
<li>Everyone in the organization is a leader, change agent and advocate who contributes to the continued improvement and advancement of the institution</li>
<li>Principled leadership and ethical behavior are the foundation for sound professional practice</li>
<li>Teamwork and collaboration are crucial for continuous organizational improvement and advancement</li>
<li>Best practice in higher education requires evidence-based and data-informed decision-making</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through 16 hours of elective courses, students may choose an area of emphasis in (1) Leadership, Governance, Organization and Policy, or (2) Institutional Research for Decision Making.  Ideally, students will begin with the Urban Higher Education Organization and Context course as an introductory seminar and complete the program with the internship (if needed) and culminating seminar, designed to help students make connections between their professional interests and academic studies, and between theory and practice.  Students may take the remaining core courses and 16 hours of elective/area of emphasis courses as their schedules allow.  If you have interest in learning more about the proposed program, please contact me at <a href="mailto:celinas@uic.edu">celinas@uic.edu</a></p>
<p>Please note that I have also included a flyer for a higher education focused course that will be offered this Spring 2019 term by Dr. Mark Martell.  If you are not a current UIC student and would like to register for the course, please contact Claire Grimmenga at <a href="mailto:claireg@uic.edu">claireg@uic.edu</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new Engaged Humanities Initiative at UIC, which is supported by a $1 million grant from the Mellon Foundation and which aims to encourage undergraduate research in the humanities, has Spring 2019 courses still available for first-year students. <em>Please share this information with your students.</em></p>
<p>These seminars are a wonderful opportunity for first-year students who have passed English 160; students should register for the seminar and its corresponding workshop.</p>
<p>By taking one of the seminar/workshop combinations, students are eligible to continue in the EHI, eventually receiving substantial funding to attend workshops, do summer research/internships/study abroad, and work with a faculty mentor on an independent research topic.</p>
<p>Here is a link to an overview of the program as well as a longer description of each of the courses.</p>
<p>Dr. Ellen McClure, the Director of the Engaged Humanities Initiative can come by to discuss the initiative in more detail but is also available for any questions at <a href="mailto:ellenmc@uic.edu">ellenmc@uic.edu</a>.</p>
